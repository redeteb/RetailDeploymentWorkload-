**Retail Deployment Project Overview**

**Purpose**

This project demonstrates an application of continuous integration and continuous deployment using popular tools to manage and deploy a web application. We use Jenkins, a tool that automates the tasks of building and testing code, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, a service that manages deploying applications to the cloud without handling the underlying servers.

**Getting Started**

Launch an EC2 Instance:

This is a virtual server in Amazon's cloud environment which will host our Jenkins automation server.

Create the instance in AWS (Amazon Web Services), and set up security settings to allow traffic on ports for SSH (secure shell access), HTTP (web traffic), and Jenkins (port 8080). By only opening these ports we are ensuring the highest security is in place. This reduces the chance of any bad actors making their way into the machine from unauthorized ports. 

Install Jenkins after connecting to your newly created EC2 instances using the following bash commands:
$sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
$echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install jenkins
$sudo systemctl start jenkins
$sudo systemctl status jenkins

Access Jenkins by navigating to http://<Your-EC2-IP-Address>:8080 in your web browser.

You can set up your project repository and instead of forking (creating a linked copy), clone the code repository directly to make an independent copy. This allows more control and customization.

Configure Jenkins multi-branch pipeline and connect to your GitHub repository by using a personal access token for secure access.

Establish IAM roles for both Elastic Beanstalk and the EC2 instance, assigning policies like AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier, AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier, and AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker to ensure proper permissions for web application deployment and operation. By only applying these permissions and nothing else, the principle of least privilege is applied which is always best practice. 

Create a new Elastic Beanstalk web server environment, selecting the Python 3.7 platform. Configure instance specifications tailored to the application’s requirements, ensuring optimal resource allocation. 

To deploy the application package the application into a zip file ensuring that the structure is flat with no nested directories at the root level to avoid ModuleNotFoundError issues. This configuration aids Elastic Beanstalk in correctly identifying the entry point of the application.

Deploy the application onto Elastic Beanstalk and troubleshoot any initial deployment errors by checking logs and ensuring the web server configuration is correct. 

**Troubleshooting**

Typical issues include incorrect port configurations or improper application packaging. Detailed log analysis helps pinpoint the exact failures in the application startup sequence.

**Optimization**

 Benefits of using managed services for cloud infrastructure include but are not limited to:
 - Simplified management because managed services abstract the underlying infrastructure complexities, allowing developers to focus solely on application development without managing servers.
 - Automatic scaling capabilities that can adjust resource allocation based on traffic demands without manual intervention.
 - Managed services ensure that the underlying systems are up to date with the latest security patches and software updates through automatic updates without manual intervention. 
 
Challenges for Retail Banks Using Managed Services:

Issue: Banks face stringent regulatory requirements that may not always align with the configurations of managed services.
Solution: Opt for cloud services that offer compliance with industry standards and regulations, and use additional security measures such as encryption and comprehensive access controls.

Issue: Dependency on a single cloud provider can lead to potential risks and challenges, such as difficulties in migration.
Solution: Design software with portability in mind using containerization (e.g., Docker) and multi-cloud strategies to diversify deployment environments.


Disadvantages of Using Elastic Beanstalk and Similar Managed Services:
- Deployment Complexity: Some applications, especially legacy ones, may require significant modifications to fit into the managed services model.
- Debugging Difficulties: Managed environments abstract many of the lower-level details, which can complicate troubleshooting and debugging efforts.

**Conclusion**
The Retail Deployment Project effectively demonstrates the application of continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, highlighting both the efficiencies and challenges of using modern CI/CD methodologies in a retail banking context. In conclusion, this project not only meets current deployment needs but also sets the stage for future enhancements that can better cater to the evolving demands of the industry, making it a valuable model for continuous improvement in CI/CD practices.
